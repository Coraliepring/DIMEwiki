# DIMEwiki

This repository stores coding best practices that DECIE's DIMEWiki is linking to. Only a private Beta version is releasd so far, but a Bank-wide launch is planned in April 2017. A fully public release will follow at a date that is yet to be decided on. This page will provide information on how to access the wiki as soon as it is publicly launched.

While technically possible and perfectly allowed, this repository is not organized in a way that makes browseing the files using GitHub's tools. Instead visit the DIMEWiki (URL to come) and read the topics there.

Any material in this wiki can be shared according to the MIT License. See http://adampritchard.mit-license.org/ or see [the `LICENSE` file](https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.
